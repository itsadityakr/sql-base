## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system (x86, 32-bit or x64, 64-bit)
- Internet connection for downloading MySQL Installer

## Downloading MySQL Installer

1. Go to the [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) page.
2. Under "MySQL Installer", find the appropriate version for your system. You can select the latest version of the MySQL Installer.
   - For 32-bit Windows, select `mysql-installer-web-community-X.X.XX.X.msi`
   - For 64-bit Windows, you may need to choose the corresponding installer if available.
3. Click the "Download" button to start the download process.

## Installing MySQL

1. Once the download is complete, run the MySQL Installer `.msi` file to start the installation process.
2. Follow the prompts in the MySQL Installer:
   - **Choose Setup Type:** Select "Developer Default" to install the MySQL Server and other related tools.
   - **Check Requirements:** The installer will check for any missing requirements. If prompted, install the necessary components.
   - **Configuration:** Configure MySQL Server settings (e.g., server type, port, root password). You can leave the default settings or adjust according to your needs.
   - **Apply Configuration:** Apply the configuration changes.

3. Finish the installation process and close the installer.

## Running MySQL Command Line Client

1. After installation, open the **MySQL Command Line Client** from the Start Menu. It should be listed under MySQL programs.
2. Enter the root password you set during the installation.
3. You should see a MySQL prompt that looks like this: `mysql>`

## Working with Databases

### Showing Databases

To list all available databases, use the following command:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

This command will display a list of all databases on the MySQL server.

### Selecting a Database

To work with a specific database, you first need to select it. Use the following command, replacing `database_name` with the name of your database:

```sql
USE database_name;
```

This command sets the specified database as the current working database.

### Creating and Using a Database

To create a new database, use the following command, replacing `database_name` with your desired database name:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

After creating the database, you can select it and create tables or perform other operations within it. For example, to create a table in the selected database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

You can then insert data into the table with:

```sql
INSERT INTO example_table (name) VALUES ('Sample Name');
```

To query data from the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM example_table;
```

## Verifying the Installation

1. At the `mysql>` prompt, run the following command to check the MySQL version:

   ```sql
   SELECT VERSION();
   ```

2. You should see the MySQL version displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Connect to MySQL Server:**
  - Ensure that the MySQL server is running. You can check this in the Services application in Windows (`services.msc`).
  - Verify that the port number and root password are correctly entered.

- **Installation Issues:**
  - Ensure you have administrative privileges during installation.
  - Check for any error messages during installation and refer to the MySQL documentation for troubleshooting specific errors.
